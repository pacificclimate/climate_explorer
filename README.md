# UI Demo for BC Climate Explorer

## Objectives

* The code in this repository demonstrates the feasibility of an interactive data visualization and analysis tool through the use of two UI controls

  * a time slider which controls the climate layer shown on a web map
  * a timeseries plot which displays the climate through time at a particular location

* This repository demonstrates these controls by using a map page of PCIC's PRISM climatology data.
* These UI controls allow users to explore and analyze climatological trends in BC for the 1971-2000 normal period

## Intended Use

* The code in this repository is *not* an application in and of itself
* It is intended to explore the use of interactive plotting, in order to start a conversation about custom decision support solutions
